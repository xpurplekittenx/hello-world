# hello-world

Hello mortal beings!

I would tell you my real name but the pronounciation is too much for such brains to comprehend,
that is why I go by "Dev". I love cats, the color purple in warmer flirtatious tones, steampunk,
and I spend alot of time debating about hidden history. Pleased to make face.
